				<li>Following the Severnaya incident, MI6 has lost track of the Pirate helicopter. Presumably the bugging device has been located and destroyed. Natalya Simonova, who returned to St. Petersburg against our advice, has gone missing. We can only assume that she has been abducted by the Janus syndicate in a belated attempt to cover their tracks.*</li>
				<li>The situation is critical, 007. Janus know we&#x27;re on to them and they&#x27;re taking control. We&#x27;re going to circumvent the usual channels on this one. I&#x27;ve arranged contact with an ex-KGB agent, Valentin Zukovsky, in Statue Park, St. Petersburg. He claims he can set up a meeting with Janus.

				<li>Valentin: Janus will meet you by Lenin&#x27;s*           statue. Beware him, he&#x27;s a Lienz*           Cossack traitor.*</li>
				<li>Valentin: Now I must leave - the guards*           are out in force and I fear they*           may mistake me for a spy!*</li>

				<li>Trevelyan: Trust can be misplaced,*              James. My parents trusted*              the British government.*</li>
				<li>Trevelyan: They were betrayed with all*              the other Lienz Cossacks.*              I will have my revenge.*</li>
